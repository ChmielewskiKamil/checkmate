# Checkmate - The Gambit companion

Checkmate is a tool to perform mutation analysis of your Solidity codebase. It
tests the mutants generated by [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit).
Checkmate is capable of automatically generating the `gambit_config.json`
files, generating the mutants with Gambit's `mutate` command and testing the
generated mutations. The goal of Checkmate is to provide a hands-off experience
for security researchers and developers to run a single command, go do something
else and come back to see the analysis results.

### Pre-requisites

- You must have [Go >=1.23](https://go.dev/dl/) installed.
- You must have Certora's [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit) installed.
- You must have something to manage your local solidity compiler version. For
  example [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) from Trail of
  Bits.

### Installation

#### Using `go install`

You can use the go's toolchain to install `checkmate`. Install it with:
```shell
`go install github.com/ChmielewskiKamil/checkmate@latest`
```

#### Building from source

Review the content of this repo do git clone and go build.

### Usage

Navigate to the project that you want to analyze. 

The usage of Checkmate is split in two stages. When you run the `checkmate`
for the first time it will generate you the `gambit_config.json` file. This is
what Gambit requires to generate the modified versions of your code (mutants).
When using Gambit alone the config generation is time consuming as you have to
configure the remappings and select the files that you want to analyze.
Checkmate is doing that for you.

Once the config is generated you can run the `checkmate` command for the second
time. This time it will see that `gambit_config.json` is ready and will attempt
to generate the mutations.
