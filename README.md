# Checkmate - The Gambit companion

Checkmate is a tool to perform mutation analysis of your Solidity codebase. It
tests the mutants generated by [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit).
Checkmate is capable of automatically generating the `gambit_config.json`
files, generating the mutants with Gambit's `mutate` command and testing the
generated mutations. The goal of Checkmate is to provide a hands-off experience
for security researchers and developers to run a single command, go do something
else and come back to see the analysis results.
