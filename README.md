# Checkmate - The Gambit companion

Checkmate is a tool to perform mutation analysis of your Solidity codebase. It
tests the mutants generated by [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit).
Checkmate is capable of automatically generating the `gambit_config.json`
files, generating the mutants with Gambit's `mutate` command and testing the
generated mutations. The goal of Checkmate is to provide a hands-off experience
for security researchers and developers to run a single command, go do something
else and come back to see the analysis results.

### TLDR;

1. Install Checkmate with: `go install github.com/ChmielewskiKamil/checkmate@latest`
2. `cd` into your Solidity's project root and run `checkmate`
3. Wait and reap the benefits (for large repos this might take a couple of hours
   to run from start to finish)

**IMPORTANT**: If you want to generate mutants with gambit as well, make sure
that you have [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit) installed.
